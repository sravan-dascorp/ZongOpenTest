Hi,


I kind of said optimisation in more general sense about the the way i made the project  ....like unstructured timelines,overall messy heirarchy etc..

I cant structure the hierachy under empty objects because some  of  objects positions will get messed up in timeline,(not sure how to fix that,i need to look into it)

I am not exactly  sure about what to really optimize from the code side considering how little code it have and very basic mechanics the test asked..



But the things i usually use temporarily that i have used here would be linq.I usually change  them in production versions if its a big list or regularly updated.


well i cant think of much optimisation without changing the overal structure and redability..


But some things i think could improve perfomance but not sure whether needed especially in  scope of this test. ...


the  FocusRaycast() function inside PlayerActions Script ,it could be updated on a slower frame rate or 3 times a second?! maybe...

well other hardcore optimisations i think could be way overkill would be  byte references like usually done for multiplayer games.

using arrays instead of list or maybe a diffrent data structure!

using switch stements!? 

Maybe the Global list for items and using an integer to identify specific item(scriptable Obj) instead of having references field in each instances around the game world.
